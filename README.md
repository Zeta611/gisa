# GISA: A Gentle Introduction to Static Analysis
An implementation of "a very basic language" presented in
*Introduction to Static Analysis: An Abstract Interpretation Perspective* by
Kwangkeun Yi and Xavier Rival.

## Implementation
### The Interpreter
The interpreter implements the presented langauge as-is, with a point to be
noted: the syntax for the arguments to the `init` statement and the syntax for
*numbers* are specified.

### The Static Analyzer (TBD)
[The double description method](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0060202)
is used to convert V- and H-representation of convex polygons.
